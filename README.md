This is just my current config for neovim. Feel free to copy. I am just keeping this here so it is easy for me to update my current config if I change computers or something breaks and get on with my life.

If you want to copy this,

1. Clone the NVChad neovim config
2. run `git clone https://github.com/MercuricChloride/nvchad_config ~/.config/nvim/lua/custom`
